# ⚡ Arduino Playground

Welcome to my sandbox for learning and experimenting with **Arduino**.  
I’m following along with the 📘 *Arduino Workshop* by John Boxall, building out projects as I go.

## 🛠️ What This Repo Is
- A collection of sketches I write while learning  
- Based on projects and exercises from *Arduino Workshop*  
- A way to track my journey into electronics + embedded programming

## 🎯 Goal
Hands-on practice with Arduino to understand electronics, programming, and prototyping.
