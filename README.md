# Arduino Playground ðŸš€

This is my collection of sketches and experiments while working through *Arduino Workshop* by John Boxall and beyond.  
Itâ€™s both a learning log and a playground for testing ideas with Arduino.

---

## About
Iâ€™m following along with the projects in *Arduino Workshop* while also adding my own experiments.  
Each project is in its own folder with the `.ino` sketch file.

---

## Structure (example)
- 01_blink â†’ Basic LED blink test  
- 02_pwm_fade â†’ Fade an LED with PWM  
- 03_button_input â†’ Button press input  
- ...  

---

## Hardware
- Arduino Uno (R3 clone) [replace with your board]  
- Jumper wires, resistors, LEDs, pushbuttons  
- Breadboard  
- Extra modules/sensors from the book  

---

## How to Run
1. Clone the repo:  
   `git clone https://github.com/Don-Doricent/arduino-playground.git`  
2. Open a project folder in the [Arduino IDE](https://www.arduino.cc/en/software).  
3. Upload to the board.  
4. Wire the circuit (if needed) and test.
